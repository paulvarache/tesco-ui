## Make it work

After cloning the repo, just run a bower install. Then just deliver the content of the folder with any static file server you want. (http-server/python -m SimpleHttpServer).

## Tests

When your server is running go to the /test url. It will run the tests on your browser. If you want to run on multiple browsers, install [wct](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) and the run `wct` it will open all the browsers on your computer and run the test against them using selenium.
